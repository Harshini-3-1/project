Recipe Sharing Platform API
This API allows users to perform CRUD operations on recipes. It is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-sharing-api.git
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd recipe-sharing-api
npm install
Set up your MongoDB database and update the connection string in server.js.

Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
API Endpoints
User Registration
POST /register
Body: { "username": "your-username", "password": "your-password" }
Registers a new user.
User Login
POST /login
Body: { "username": "your-username", "password": "your-password" }
Logs in an existing user and returns a JWT token for authentication.
Create a Recipe
POST /recipes
Requires authentication (include JWT token in the Authorization header).
Body: { "title": "Recipe Title", "description": "Recipe Description", "ingredients": ["Ingredient 1", "Ingredient 2"], "instructions": "Recipe Instructions", "image": "Recipe Image URL" }
Creates a new recipe.
Get All Recipes
GET /recipes
Returns a list of all recipes.
Example Usage
Register a new user:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/register -d '{"username": "john", "password": "password"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
Login to get a JWT token:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login -d '{"username": "john", "password": "password"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
Create a new recipe (replace {TOKEN} with the JWT token):

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/recipes -d '{"title": "Spaghetti Carbonara", "description": "A classic Italian pasta dish", "ingredients": ["Spaghetti", "Eggs", "Bacon", "Parmesan Cheese"], "instructions": "Cook spaghetti, fry bacon, mix eggs and cheese, combine all ingredients", "image": "https://example.com/spaghetti-carbonara.jpg"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}"
Get all recipes:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:3000/recipes
OOP Concepts
Encapsulation: The User and Recipe classes encapsulate data and methods related to users and recipes, respectively, providing a clean interface for interacting with these entities.
Inheritance: While not explicitly demonstrated in this example, inheritance could be used to create specialized types of recipes or users (e.g., PremiumUser extending User).
Polymorphism: The authenticate method in the User class demonstrates polymorphism, as it provides different implementations based on the specific user instance.
Using OOP concepts helps to organize the code, improve maintainability, and make it easier to add new features in the future.
